# Custom Units

This system offers a variety of units to support accurate inventory keeping. However, we recognize that we can't cover all bases out-of-the-box. As such, we support adding custom units.

To see current available units, simply hit the `/api/v1/unit` endpoint with a GET request: `curl -X 'GET' 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/unit' -H 'accept: application/json'`

See the swagger entries for units for more complete details.
