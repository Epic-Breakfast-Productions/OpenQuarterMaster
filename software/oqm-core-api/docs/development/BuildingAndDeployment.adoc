== Building

=== Prerequisites

* Java 21 (OpenJDK or Oracle JDK)
* Gradle 8.5+
* Docker (for building container images)
* Native Image (optional, for native builds)

=== Building with Gradle

==== JVM Build

To build the application for JVM:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
----

This creates a JAR file in `build/libs/`.

==== Native Build

To build a native executable (requires GraalVM):

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true
----

Note: Native builds require significant memory and CPU resources.

==== Running Development Mode

For hot-reload development:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew quarkusDev
----

The application will be available at http://localhost:8080

=== Building Docker Images

==== JVM Docker Image

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm -t oqm-core-api:latest .
----

==== Native Docker Image

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew build -Dquarkus.native.enabled=true -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
docker build -f src/main/docker/Dockerfile.native -t oqm-core-api:latest .
----

=== Building Installers

To create system packages (DEB, RPM):

[source,bash]
----
./makeInstallers.sh
----

This script:
- Builds the application
- Creates Docker images
- Generates system packages in `build/installers/`

=== Testing

==== Unit Tests

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew test
----

==== Integration Tests

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew integrationTest
----

== Deployment

=== Configuration

This is a list of relevant config values for configuring a running instance of Open QuarterMaster Base Station. These variables can be passed via environment variables.
