== Introduction

This script exists to manage your instance of Open QuarterMaster.

Due to the administrative tasks this script performs, it must be run as root, or with `sudo`.

== Modes

=== Interactive

This is the default mode, run when no arguments are passed. This provides a simple, console-based interface. When running from the system app icon, this is the mode that is run.

To navigate, use `arrow keys`.

To confirm an action, hit `enter`.

To select/deselect an option, press `space`.

You can also navigate by clicking on the menu items you want to select.

==== Flow

When starting up, the script performs a quick check to ensure the core system is installed.
If the core components are not installed, it will prompt you to install them.

==== Menu System

This is a quick explanation of the menus in interactive mode.
