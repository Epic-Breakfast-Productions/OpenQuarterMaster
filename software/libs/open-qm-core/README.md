# Open QuarterMaster Core Library

THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS DEAD

It is slated for removal. It is only here as a reference until we finish a couple of other small tasks. Please ignore this project

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/tech.epic-breakfast-productions.openQuarterMaster.lib/open-qm-lib-core/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/tech.epic-breakfast-productions.openQuarterMaster.lib/open-qm-lib-core)

## TODOS:

- move search objects to this library
- Make classes use @SuperBuilder rather than @builder
- Ensure classes use super tostring
- Get deployable to Maven Central
  - Figure out signing https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#signing_plugin
  - make account? get working https://maven.apache.org/repository/guide-central-repository-upload.html
- Make Java Unit classes have accurate examples in OpenApi
