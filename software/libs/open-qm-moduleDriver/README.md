# Open QuarterMaster Core Library


THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT IS DEAD

It is slated for removal. It is only here as a reference until we finish a couple of other small tasks. Please ignore this project


## TODOS:

- Get deployable to Maven Central
    - Figure out signing https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html#signing_plugin
    - make account? get working https://maven.apache.org/repository/guide-central-repository-upload.html
- Make Java Unit classes have accurate examples in OpenApi
