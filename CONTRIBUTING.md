### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Typically, working branches are structured as `dev/<issue # / name>`, to help denote the branch flow

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the form of a Github discussion, then if positive feedback, add a new feature request and start writing code.
