# Open QuarterMaster Delpoyment Methods

This directory holds the different ways you can easily run Open QuarterMaster.

 - Have a dedicated computer, virtual machine, or cloud server? [Single Host](Single%20Host) is your best bet. This is the recommended way to run OQM.

Unsure, or don't want to install anything to try things out? Check out our [Demo](https://openquartermaster.com/public/demo)!
