# Infrastructure Service Files

Service files for non-installer services, not made by this project.

Installed by:

```
sudo cp <file>.service /etc/systemd/system/

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

... (service can now be managed by usual systemctl commands)
```


## TODO's

- Document how service username/passwords are to be handled
