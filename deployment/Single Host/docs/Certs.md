# HTTPS Certs Management Guide

[Back](README.md)

In order to be secure, we ensure all external (and most internal) communication is performed over HTTPS.

To support this, we have robust support for SSL certs that integrate with our services to provide this.

To be flexible to your usecase, we support several modes of how these certs are acquired. These are explained below.

## Config

All config related to certs are placed under `cert.*` in config. Explanation below.

| Config Key             | Default | Explanation                                                                               |
|------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `cert.externalDefault` | `self`  | The default cert to configure in the proxy. Must be one of `self`, `acme`, or `provided`. |
| `cert.selfSigned`      |         | The configuration block for self signed certs. See below for info.                        |
| `cert.acme`            |         | The configuration block for acme (Lets Encrypt) certs. See below for info.                |
| `cert.provided`        |         | The configuration block for provided certs. See below for info.                           |

## Certs For External Use

The system is quite flexible to what certs are included in the external proxy interface, as well as which cert is
considered 'default'.

There are three modes for defining and including certs for the system to use for external connections. To be clear:

- this concerns what certs are configured in the proxy, and what cert is considered 'default' (as defined by
  `cert.externalDefault`)
- All certs available are included in the proxy.
- Internally used certs are all self-signed, based on the root CA generated.

### Self

The system automatically generates a Certificate Authority and certs for automatically encrypting external and internal
traffic. This is intended to provide an out of the box robust and secure system.

The Certificate authority is automatically installed on the system in order to be trusted locally. This root CA (
`cert.certs.CARootCert`) can be copied to other systems in order to establish trust.

The cert used for external communication (self-signed external system cert) automatically includes `system.hostname` as
a domain/IP covered by the cert.

Use this when it is just you or your organization using the software locally, and don't have a cert or CA of your own.

It is important to note that these certs are generated and used internally even when `cert.externalDefault` is not set
to `self`. See "Internal Certs" below for more information.

### ACME (Let's Encrypt)

When `cert.externalDefault` is set to `acme`, this configures the proxy to reach out to an ACME provider to get a cert
to use for external communication. These certs are only retrieved if set as the default.

By default, the proxy is configured to use the TLS challenge method.

### Provided

When `cert.externalDefault` is set to `provided`, this configures the proxy to use certs that are provided by you. Use
this if your company has a cert structure and want this system to follow it.

> [!TIP]
> If using provided certs as default, remember to set `cert.provided.enabled` set to `true`, as well as reviewing the
> rest of the configuration below to ensure success.

| `cert.provided.enabled` |         | If to include the provided cert in the certs used by the proxy. |
| `cert.provided.cert`    |         | The location on the system where the provided cert resides.     |
| `cert.provided.key`     |         | The location on the system where the provided cert key resides  |

## Internal Certs

Certs are given to services in order to encrypt traffic behind the proxy. These certs are intended to be based on the
self-signed root CA, generated for each service, and regenerated often.

You typically shouldn't need to be concerned with these certs, but it is helpful to know about them.
