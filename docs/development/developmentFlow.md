# OQM Development Workflow

In general, we adhere to the following guidelines to perform work on this repo:

## Branching

Branches:

- `main`
  - our default branch
  - is the current source of truth, where releases are cut
- `development`
  - where changes being staged for release go
  - final review into `main`
- `dev/[issue #]-[issue name]`
  - where work happens
